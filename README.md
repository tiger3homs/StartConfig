Auto Command Snippet for http://www.play-cs.com/

This snippet automatically executes predefined commands in the in-game chat at the start of each round. It is designed to enhance gameplay by automating repetitive tasks, like binding keys or sending initial messages, without interfering with normal chat use.

Installation / Usage

1. Open DevTools.

2. Go to the Sources tab → Snippets (left sidebar).

3. Click New Snippet, give it a name, and paste the snippet code.

4. Save the snippet.

5. Right-click the snippet → Run, or press Ctrl + Enter / Cmd + Enter while editing.

The snippet will now run automatically on the page, and you can rerun it any time without pasting it again.

Customizing Commands

Commands are stored in a simple array at the top of the snippet:


    const commands = [
        ['bind "f1" "say is it live? 🎥❓"', true],  ((true], // true = enabled, false = disabled))
        ['bind "f2" "say LIVE 🔴✨"', true],
        ['bind "f3" "say NOT LIVE ⚪❌"', true],
        ['bind "f4" "say KNIVES 🔪🗡️"', true],

            ["cl_lw 1", true],
            ["cl_lc 1", true],
    ];

To add a new command, follow the same format: [commandString, true/false].

How it Works

The snippet polls the game timer every 0.5 seconds.

When the timer is not 0:00 and commands have not yet been executed this round, it submits all enabled commands.

Once the commands are executed, the snippet does not run again until the next round.

You can still type and use the chat normally—your input will not be overwritten.

Features

Automatically runs a list of user-defined commands once per round.

Resets when the round ends (0:00 timer), ready for the next round.

Does not overwrite your chat input after execution.

Easy to customize commands by editing a simple array.

Important Notes

Make sure your commands are correct; syntax errors may prevent the snippet from running.

This snippet is safe for Chrome and requires no additional extensions.
