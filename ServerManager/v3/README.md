# CS Server Manager Reforged (Tampermonkey Script)

**Transform your play-cs.com/myservers page into a powerful, organized server management hub.**

This Tampermonkey script provides a complete overhaul of the server management interface on [play-cs.com/myservers](https://play-cs.com/myservers). It replaces the standard table layout with a modern, collapsible card system, adding numerous quality-of-life features designed to make managing your Counter-Strike servers more efficient and enjoyable.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Collapsible Server Cards:** Each of your servers is displayed as an individual card. Click the header to expand or collapse it, revealing or hiding detailed settings.

    *   Edit server name, enable/disable, and public/private status directly.
    *   Adjust individual CVar settings.
    *   View real-time status updates in the card header (e.g., Enabled/Disabled, Visible/Hidden, current map).
*   **Configuration Presets:**
    *   Quickly apply predefined settings for common game modes like "Public," "5vs5," and "Deathmatch" with a single click.
    *   Automatically sets relevant checkboxes and CVars according to the chosen preset.
