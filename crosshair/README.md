CS Crosshair - Manager
A highly customizable userscript for adding a custom crosshair to play-cs.com.
This script provides a persistent, static crosshair with a full-featured editor, allowing you to fine-tune its appearance to your liking. It also includes a profile system, so you can save and switch between different crosshair designs effortlessly.

üöÄ Features
Editor with Sliders and Color Pickers: Easily adjust the crosshair's length, thickness, gap, color, and opacity.

Profiles System: Save your favorite crosshair configurations to different profiles. You can create, load, rename, and delete profiles, allowing for quick changes between different play styles or preferences.

Advanced Effects: Add a shadow for increased visibility against bright backgrounds and a border (outline) for a sharp, clean look.

In-Game Control: A small, non-intrusive UI panel appears at the bottom-left of the screen for quick access to the main editor and crosshair toggles.

Pointer Lock Integration: The script intelligently manages the game's PointerLock, automatically exiting it when you open the UI menu to allow for mouse interaction, and re-engaging it when you close the menu.

Persistence: Your settings and profiles are saved locally in your browser, so they'll be there the next time you visit the site.
